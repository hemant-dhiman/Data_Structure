    /**
     * We are given a row wise sorted matrix of size r*c, we need to find the median of the matrix given. It is assumed that r*c is always odd.
     *
     * Input:
     * The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains two integers r and c, where r is the number of rows and c is the number of columns in the array a[]. Next r line contains space separated c elements each in the array a[].â€‹
     *
     * Output:
     * Print an integer which is the median of the matrix.
     *
     * Constraints:
     * 1<= T <=100
     * 1<= r,c <=150
     * 1<= a[i][j] <=1000
     *
     * Example:
     * Input:
     * 1
     * 3 3
     * 1 3 5
     * 2 6 9
     * 3 6 9
     *
     * Output:
     * 5
